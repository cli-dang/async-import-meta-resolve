## Installation

___

```shell
npm install @cli-dang/async-import-meta-resolve
```

___

## Usage

Let's say we need to know if the package `lodash` is installed.

```typescript
import { async_import_meta_resolve } from 'async-import-meta-resolve'

let lodash_is_installed: string | Error = await async_import_meta_rosolve('lodash').catch(error=>error)
if(lodhash_is_installed instanceof Error)
  console.error('lodash not found')
else console.log(`lodash found and its location is -> ${lodash_is_installed}`)
```
